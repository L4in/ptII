This folder contains two set of demos:

- MonoInstance: models working up to revision 71843 where only one instance of each
object class could be discovered. This version was implemented by Gilles Lasnier.

- StaticMultiInstance: models working up to revision 71943, where multiple instances of
an object class could be discovered. An HlaSubscriber must be add for each foreseen
instance of a subscribed class. This version was implemented by David Come.

The folder CoSimulation was removed because the compilation of the C++ federate was not working. The original demo can be found on revision r71843 on 
$PTII/ptolemy/apps/hlacerti/demo/CoSimulation

Co-simulation with Ptolemy federates and C++ federates can be found here:
- For r71943: /Users/j.cardoso/ptIIforCommit/ptII/org/hlacerti/demo/legacy/StaticMultiInstance/Billard
- For current revision: /Users/j.cardoso/ptIIforCommit/ptII/org/hlacerti/demo/Billard

-> May be add here a folder "DynamicMultiInstance" with some models up to revision 77500."
